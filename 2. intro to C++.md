**Topics**: #CS C++


# Reading
## Chapter 2
- **2.1 The parts of a C++ Program**
	- C++ anatomy changes
	- double backslash to comment ' // '
	- ' # ' means a *preprocessor directive*
	- *preprocessor directive*: #vocab
		- preprocessor reads your program **BEFORE IT IS COMPILED** and only executes the lines beginning with a ' # '
		- "sets up" the program
	- '#include' directive causes the preprocessor to include contents of another file, known as a *header file*
	- *header file*: #vocab 
		- a source file that is meant to be included at the top of another source file
		- it should be included at the header or the top of the program
	- '*iostream*' is the name of the header file to be included
	- the '<>' brackets indicate that the file is a standard C++ header file
	- *iostream*:
		- contains code that allows C++ to display *output* on the screen and read *input* from the keyboard
	- *using namespace std;* 
		- C++ uses *namespaces* #vocab to organize the names of program entities
			- A way in which the _names_ of program entities are organized
		- the statement "using namespace std;" declares that the program will be accessing entities whose names are part of the **namespace** called **std**
		- the reason the program needs to access the **std** namespace is: every name created by the **iostream** file is part of that **namespace**
		- in order for a program to use the entities in **iostream**, it must have access to the **std** namespace
	- *int main()*
		- function declaration
		- *function*: #vocab
			- a group of one or more programming *statements* that collectively have a name
		- this function name is __main__
		- the set of parentheses that follow the name indicate that it is a function
			- parentheses can include the parameters but the textbook doesn't cover that here lol
		- the word **int** stands for *integer*
		- this indicates that the function *returns* an integer value when it is finished executing
		- **EVERY** C++ program has a main function
		- main is the "starting point" of the program
	- *{ }* 
		- braces indicate the opening and closing of a *function*
		- statements are enclosed here
	- *cout << "Programming is great fun!"*
		- this line displays the message on the screen
		- the group of characters inside of the quotation marks are called a *string literal* #vocab or a *string constant* #vocab
			- *string literal / string constant*:
				- a group of characters that are written inside of quotation marks in a program
		- "*cout*" and "*<<*" covered later in this chapter
	- *return 0;*
		- sends the integer value back to the operating system
		- value 0 indicates that the program ran successfully
- **2.2 The 'cout'  Object**
	- the simplest type of screen output that a program can display is *console output*
	- *console output*: #vocab
		- simple text displayed as output by a program
	- *console*: #vocab 
		- old computer term from when the user interacted with a system by typing in the terminal
		- the terminal consisted of a screen and a keyboard, known as the console
	- modern computers run graphical operating systems like Windows and Mac
	- *cout* is used to produce console output
	- think of *cout* as console output
	- *cout* is classified as a *stream object*: #vocab 
		- an object that works with streams of data
		- a stream of data would be the "Programming is fun!" string (stream of characters)
	- *<<* is used to send the string to *cout*
	- *<<* when used this way is called the *stream insertion operator*: #vocab
		- operator that is used to send streams of data to a *stream object*
	- stream insertion operator can be used to send more than one item to *cout*
		- cout << "programming is " << "great fun!";
	- *cout* is displayed as a continuous stream (no default new line)
	- **Displaying a new Line**
		- there are two ways to do this
		- the first is to send a *stream manipulator* #vocab called **endl** (end line)
			- An operator that causes a stream object to format its output in a certain way
		- the second way is to use an *escape sequence* #vocab 
			- a special sequence of one or more characters that have special meaning in the string. Start with  \  and followed by one or more control characters
			- **\n** is the escape sequence for **new line**
			- escape sequence has to be inside of the string
			- ![[Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 12.47.13 PM.png]]
	- **Raw String Literals**
		- Some strings contain backslashes that are not meant to be an escape sequence
		- **path**: #vocab 
			- string that specifies the location of a file or folder on a computer system
		- Backslash is used to separate the folder names
		- To avoid the computer misinterpreting the back slashes in the string, you should use a **Raw String Literal**: #vocab 
			- A string literal where escape sequences are not processed. Things like backslashes are interpreted as literally a backslash
		- in C++ a raw string literal begins with **R"()"**
			- ex: R"(this is a raw sting literal. I \ Can \ Do \ This!)"
- **2.3 the '#include' Directive**
	- the iostream header needs to be included in any program using the *cout* object
	- *cout* is not included in the "core" C++ language
	- *cout* is part of the *input-output stream library*: #vocab 
		- C++ standard library defining the iostream objects
	- iostream file contains information describing the iostream objects
	- compiler needs it to compile code with cout
	- **Preprocessor directives** are **NOT** C++ statements
		- they are commands to the preprocessor
	- **preprocessor** runs prior to the compiler
	- **preprocessor**'s job is to set up programs in a way that makes the programmer's job easier
	- *#include* directives must **always** contain the name of a file
- **2.4 Variables, Literals, and Assignment Statements**
	- *Variables*
		- **variables** allow us to store and work with data in a computer's memory
		- the provide an *interface* to RAM
		- Part of the programmer's job is to determine how many variables a program will need and what types of info they will hold
		- *variable definition*: #vocab
			- a *statement* that *defines* a **variable** by a certain *name* and *type*
		- *variable assignment*: #vocab
			- a *statement* that *stores* a *value* into a **variable**
		- variables can reassign their values, but they do not get redefined
		- variables can be printed using *cout*
			- cout << "string here" << number << endl;
		- placing double quotes around any value when assigning a variable makes that value a string literal
		- you can only store values of the correct type in a variable
			- int cannot store a string
			- string cannot store an int
	- **Literals**
		- **literal**: #vocab
			- a piece of data that is written directly into a program's code
		- literals are used to assign values into variables
			- number = 100;
			- '100' is an integer literal 
		- literals can also be used to display statements to the screen
			- see cout statements for an example
- **2.5 Identifiers**
	- **Identifiers**
		- *identifier*: #vocab 
			- programmer-defined name that represents some element of a program, such as variables
		- Variable names are an example of identifiers
		- Variable names are chosen by the programmer
		- Variable names *cannot* be C++ keywords
		- The keywords make up the "core" of the language and have specific purposes
		- **C++ Key Words**
			- ![[Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 1.36.10 PM.png]]
		- variable names should be *descriptive* and *indicate the variable's purpose*
		- variable names should be clear to anyone reading the code
		- *self-documenting programs*: #vocab
			- programs that can be understood just by reading the code
	- **Legal Identifiers**
		- be consistent with variable names
		- make them *as descriptive as possible*
		- **some rules for identifiers**
			- the first character must be a letter *A-Z* or an *underscore*
			- after the first letter you can use any letter, number or an underscore
			- upper and lowercase are distinct
				- ItemsOrdered and itemsordered are different
		- **Some examples of legal and illegal identifiers**
			- ![[Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 1.45.06 PM.png]]
- **2.6 Integer Data Types**
	- *Numeric* data can be broken into two categories
	- *Integer*
		- whole numbers  
		- 1, -34, 567
	- *Floating point*
		- fractional numbers (decimal point)
		- 1.2, 4.98, 10000.0000001
	- *Integer* and *Floating-point* data is broken down further
	- *considerations* for picking a specific *numeric data type* of a variable
		- The largest and smallest numbers that may be stored in the value
		- how much memory the variable uses
		- whether the variable stores *signed* or *unsigned* numbers
		- the number of decimal places of precision the variable has
	- **Int Data Types**:
		- ![[Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 9.23.09 AM.png]]
	- Integer size is dependent on the type of system being used
		- **ONLY** guarantees:
			- Int >= short int
			- Long ints >= int
			- Unsigned short int == short
			- unsigned int == int
			- unsigned long int == long int
			- long long int and unsigned long long int data types are at least 8 bytes long
	- *unsigned*: #vocab
		- can *only* store positive / nonnegative numbers
		- uses all bits for the value, resulting in a larger range
	- *unsigned* values can be useful for things like age and weight, values that cannot be negative
	- *single quote marks* can act as digit separators
	- *integer literal*: #vocab
		- a whole number that is treated as an int and written into a programs source code
	- C++ allows us to **change** the *way something is stored in memory*
		- if we have an int literal but we need to change it to a long integer, we can do that
	- *see code at bottom*
		- first statement defines a long variable named amount
		- the second statement assigns the value 32 to the variable
		- the literal is written as "32L" which makes it a *long integer literal*
		- etc. for long long
	- **Binary**, **Hexadecimal** and **Octal** Literals
		- decimal (base 10) is not the only system
		- Binary (base 2)
		- Hexadecimal (base 16)
		- Octal (base 8)
		- C++ **assumes** base 10 for integer literals
		- you can express binary numbers by placing **0b** (zero)
		- hexadecimal **0x**
		- Octal is just the **0**
- **2.7 The 'char' Data type**
	- **char** is used to store individual characters
	- char can only hold one character at a time
	- *character literals*: #vocab 
		- a character of data, enclosed in single quotation marks, written in a program's source code
		- ex: letter = 'g';
	- character literals use single ( ' ' ) quotes
	- *char* cannot be used to sore *strings* (more than one character)
	- **strings** use double quotes ( " " )
	- the single / double quote distinction prevents us from assigning something like "g" to a char. The literal *must* be a character literal, which means it *must* use single quotes
	- *char* data type is actually an integer that typically uses *1 byte* 
		- size is system dependent
	- Characters are internally represented by numbers
	- Each printable character as well as many non printable characters are assigned a unique number
		- the most commonly used *character encoding* method is *ASCII* (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
	- When storing a character, the numeric code is stored
	- when printing, a computer displays the character corresponding with the numeric code
	- *String Literals vs Character Literals*
		- *Strings* are a series of *characters* stored in *consecutive* memory locations
		- locations can be virtually any length, so there needs to be some way to tell the computer that the string has ended / how long the string is
		- C++ uses an extra byte at the end
		- In the last byte the number 0 is stored
		- this is called the *null terminator*: #vocab
			- a byte that is set to the value 0 and stored at the end of a string
			- signifies the end of a string to the computer
		- how would "foobar" be stored in memory?
			- | f | o | o | b | a | r | \0 |
		- although the string is only 6 bytes long, it takes up 7 bytes in memory
		- If we were to store the letter A in memory as a *string* and as a *char*, how would it look?
			- string: | A | \0 |
			- char: | A |
			- both of the literals look the same, save for the change in quotes
- **2.8 the C++ 'string' class**
	- Because a char can only store one character, strings are needed to store words and sentences
	- C++ does not have a built in *string* type
	- to use strings in C++, we have to include the string class in the header
		- *#include <string* (closing bracket breaks obsidian a little lol)
	- next, define the string
		- string movieTitle;
	- assign a string literal to the variable
		- movieTitle = 'The Fellowship of The Ring'
	- you can use cout to display the value of the string
	- the string class handles the null terminator for us
- **2.9 Floating-Point Data Types**
	- *floating-point numbers*: #vocab 
		- numeric values that can contain a fractional value
		- the fractional value is expressed as a decimal number
	- internally the floating-point numbers are stored similar to scientific notation 
	- computers use E notation ( E for exponential?)
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 12.12.03 PM.png]]
	- all types (float, double, long double) are signed
	- float literals can be written in different ways
		- E notation 
		- decimal notation
		- decimal is preferable for smaller numbers (small in character) like 4.75
		- E is preferable for larger numbers (in character length) like a billion
	- floating point literals are usually stored in memory as doubles, but you can force it as a float using "f"
	- *Assigning floating-point values to integers*
		- assigning a float to an int will drop the fractional part of the number
		- assigning 7.5 to an int will ~~round~~ **truncate** it to 7 
		- *Truncate*: #vocab 
			- to shorten or cutoff a piece of data
- **2.10 the Bool Data Type**
	- *Boolean Expressions*: #vocab
		- an expression evaluated as either **true** or **false**
		- 1 or 0, yes or no, happy or sad
		- can be **ONE** of **TWO** total values
		- named after George Boole
	- the bool data type lets us create small integer variables that are suitable for holding true or false values
	- you can assign the bool to *true* or *false* however it is represented as a 1 for true and a 0 for false in memory
- **2.11 Determining the Sized of a Data Type**
	- the problem with portability of C++ is the lack of common sizes of data types on each computer
	- the **sizeof** operator can report the number of bytes of memory used by any data type or variable
- **2.12 More about variable assignments and Initialization**
	- '*=*' is the assignment operator
	- the assignment operator has two operands
	- the variable name is always the operand on the left side of the operator
	- *lvalue*: #vocab (L - value)
		- identifies a place in memory for the value to be stored
		- left side of the operator
	- *rvalue*: #vocab
		- any expression that has a value
		- right side of assignment operator
	- you can assign values to variables at definition
		- this is called *initialization*
	- C++ allows us to define several variables while only initializing some
	- *Declaring Variables with the auto Key Word*
		- C++ 11 introduced an alternative way to define variables using the auto keyword
		- auto will automatically determine the type 
- **2.13 Scope**
	- a variable's **scope** is the part of the program that has access to the variable
	- *scope*: #vocab
		- The part of the program where a variable may be used
	- every variable has scope
	- A variable cannot be used in any part of the program before the definition
	- revisited later in the book
- **2.14 Arithmetic Operatiors**
	- C++ offers a multitude of operators for data manipulation
	- There are 3 types of operators 
		- *unary*:  #vocab 
			- an operator that takes *one* operand
			- ex: -5, (negation operator)
		- *binary*: #vocab 
			- an operator that takes *two* operands
			- Addition, subtraction, mult etc
			- modulus gives the remainder
		- *ternary*: #vocab 
			- an operator that takes *three* operands
		- *Integer Division*
			- when both operands of a division statement are integers, the statement will result in an integer
			- the remainder is discarded
			- this happens even if the result is assigned to a floating-point variable
			- in order to get a fractional result, one of the values needs to be a floating point value
		- *calculating Percentages and Discounts*
			- the % symbol is used for modulo and not for percentages
			- we have to convert a percentage into a floating point number
			- see the code at the bottom
		- *Using modulus operator and integer division*
			- an example could be extracting the rightmost digit of a number
				- %10 gives you rightmost
				- %100 gives two rightmost
				- %1000 gives three rightmost 
				- etc.
			- 
- **2.15 Comments**
	- comments are ignored by the compiler
	- comments are liberally written in the source code
	- use to annotate code and what it does
	- double forward slash ( // ) to comment in C++
	- multi line comments with ( /* ) to open and ( * /  )to close
- **2.16 Named Constants**
	- *Contant*:
		- stored data, like a variable
		- does not change its value while the program is running
	- const double INTEREST_RATE = 0.069;
	- const before the definition
	- name of the constant is written in all uppercase characters
	- Naming constants helps make the program self documenting
- **2.16 Programming Style**
	- *Programming style:* #vocab
		- the way a programmer uses *identifiers*, *spaces*, *tabs*, *blank lines*, and *punctuation* to visually arrange source code
		- some, but not all of the elements that define a programming style
	- Style is not relevant to the compiler
	- purely for readability
	- allows the reader to quickly identify key info about the program
	- ideally this is consistent
