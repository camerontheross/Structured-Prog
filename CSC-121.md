**The course will be organized by Module. Each Module on this page will be a link to a page that contains a study guide for that particular Module. That study guide will contain sort of a checklist to help guide you through the material.  Also, each study guide will contain a link to a zip file that contains materials for the concepts covered in that Module.**

I will continue to add Modules over the next 14 weeks. **In addition to the zip files containing the textbook materials, I will be providing some additional tutorials, some videos, MPL (My Programming Lab) exercises, and other resources to help you navigate your way through the remaining material.  Also included in the Modules will be Assignment links through which you will be submitting your labs and projects.**
