**Canvas**

The course will be delivered through a Learning Management System called Canvas.

Once logged into Canvas you will have access to:

- **Course Modules** (All course materials can be downloaded from here)
- **Videos and other miscellaneous materials**
- **Announcements (periodic announcements as necessary**
- **Assignment Links(**Your labs, quizzes, projects, and assignments will be submitted to specified assignment links in Canvas)

**Other Course Materials:**

Read the documents in each Module which can be accessed via **Canvas**

**Software:**

**To use C++ with a JetBrains IDE like CLion or Rider on Windows 11, you need to install a C++ compiler and then configure your IDE to use it. JetBrains IDEs do not come with a built-in C++ compiler.**

**Course Activities:**

The online activities will include videos of formal and informal lectures and lab session instructions.  During lectures, new material and assigned problems will be explained. Students are encouraged to contribute to the discussion and to ask questions about the material using the Discussion board. Structured, supervised, "hands-on" lab sessions are built-in to the semester schedule. These sessions will be structured to support material presented during lecture.  Completion of the laboratory exercises are mandatory.

**Attendance:**

All assignments need to be completed in a timely manner. 

**Additional Policies:**

- Academic Honesty

- Review the “Academic Honesty Policy” in the student handbook. Students who copy homework, cheat on the examination or plagiarize materials for the homework, or projects or labs or tests in this course are subject to receiving a **failing grade for the course**.

**Laboratory Sessions:**

There will be 2 types of labs on which you will be graded.

- Revel Structured Lab Exercise labs are completed online and **must be completed by the due date** in order to receive credit. There will be many short, auto-graded coding exercises based on the concepts that are currently being covered.  These exercises will help you master fundamental programming concepts.  These exercises will be similar in style to the Revel Structured Lab Exercise that you completed in CSC121.  Late Revel Structured Lab Exercise will receive a grade of 0.
- There is the lab assignment on Canvas  which is created by me and will be more comprehensive than the Revel Structured Lab Exercise.  **Late labs will be penalized 50% of the score.  Labs NOT submitted before the availability date will receive a grade of 0.**  Students should strive to turn in all work completed by the due date.   Occasionally I will extend the deadline for labs if circumstances warrant it.

**Projects:**

There will be 5  homework projects. The projects count 20% toward the final course grade. All projects are to be coded by you.

Project grades will be determined using the following criteria:

- Output: Accuracy and organization
- Is the program well documented?
- Has the program been coded using good software engineering practices?
- Have all the project requirements as specified been met? **Programs not meeting the requirements as specified will receive significant deductions even if the output is correct.**

Guidelines for grading are described in grading rubrics for each project that include:

- Project Evaluation
- Test Plans
- Documentation
- Object-oriented design
- Solution Methodology
- Output

**No credit will be given for late projects**.  If you have not completed the project by the due date, turn in what you have for partial credit.

Any student taking credit for another person's work will receive a zero for that project. You may be asked to explain work submitted.

Each student is responsible for making sure that work submitted is “clean”. If any virus is found, you will receive a zero for that project.

**Quizzes:** To be determined

**Academic Integrity:** Cheating of any kind will be cause for failing the course. The work you submit for credit must be your own, original work. This is strictly enforced.

**Grading:**

Assignment Exercises                     20%

Revel: Structured Lab Exercises     20%

Projects                                            20%

Quizzes                                            20%

Final                                                 20%

A -- 90 and above

B -- 80 to 89

C -- 70 to 79

D -- 60 to 69

F -- below 60

I -- Incomplete (Only under extreme emergencies)

W – Withdraw

- (Be sure to notify the Registrar by the deadline.) Any student who stops attending class and did not officially withdraw, will receive a NA (not attending).

Grades are assigned according to your performance on the labs, programming projects, and quizzes as described above.  **There is no extra credit in this course unless specified as a part of an exercise or project.**

**Keys to Success in this Course**

- Complete all work on time
- View the videos (multiple times if necessary), read through the text book material and review the labs before you attempt the lab assignments. (Use the syllabus as a guide).
- Contact me via email, or schedule zoom meetings with me during my office hours.
- Programming is a contact sport. The best way to learn how to program is to program.
- Since this is a 4-credit course, plan to spend 12-20 hrs per week on this course.
- This course has been carefully constructed to guide you toward mastering the material presented (the lab exercises are critically important and should never be hurried through). It is a complete package deal – you need to complete all assignments, labs, and projects.
