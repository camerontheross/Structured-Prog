- *7.1 Arrays Hold Multiple Values*
	- *Concept*: An array allows you to store and work wit multiple values of the same data type
	- The variables you have worked with so far are designed to hold only one value at at time
	- *Array*: #vocab
		- A data structure that holds a group of values of the same data type
	- Example of array declaration: [[#7.1.1]]
	- *Size declarator*: #vocab 
		- an integer specifying the size of an array
	- *Element*: #vocab 
		- A value stored in an array
	- Size declarators indicate the number of elements an array can hold
	- Size declarators *must* be an *integer* that is *greater than zero*
	- it can be a *literal* or a *named constant* (*NOT* a variable)
	- Arrays of *ANY* data type can be defined
	- *Memory Requirements of Arrays*
		- The amount of memory used by an array depends on the *data type*
		- Also depends on number of elements
		- ex:
			- *short* array with *6 elements*
			- a *short* uses *2 bytes* of memory
			- with *6 elements* the array uses *12 bytes* of memory
		- size of an array is *size of type* times *number of elements*

- *7.2 Accessing Array Elements*
	- *Concept*: The individual elements of an array are assigned unique subscripts. These subscripts are used to access the elements
	- Each element is assigned a number known as a *subscript*
	- *Subscript*: #vocab 
		- An integer value that references the location of an element in an array
	- The *first* element is assigned the value *0*
		- ascends from there
		- last element is *size* - 1
		- array with size *6* has subscripts *0-5*
	- A subscript is used as an *index* to pinpoint a specific element in the array
	- Each element can be accessed with its subscript
	- Example of *accessing* and *assigning* a value to the *first* *element* of an array: [[#7.2.1]]
	- If an *array* is defined globally, all of its *elements* are initialized to *0 by default*
	- *local arrays* have *no default initialization value*
	- *Inputting and Outputting Array Contents*
		- Array elements may be used with *cin* and *cout* objects like any other variable
	- *Stepping through an Array*
		- Even though the size declarator of an array definition *must* be a *constant or literal*, *subscript* numbers can be *stored in variables*
		- this means we can loop through arrays, performing the same operations on each element
		- Ex: [[#7.2.2]]
		- Ex [[#7.2.3]], Enter and print elements of an array
			- cout uses count + 1
			- this makes it so it displays the element as 1-5 (starts count at 1)
		- *Inputting* data in an array needs to be done one at a time
			- cin >> hours; // this does not work
		- *Outputting* also must be done one at a time
	- *Array Initialization*
		- Like regular variables, C++ lets you initialize an array's *elements* when you declare the array
		- [[#7.2.4]] 
		- *Initialization list*: #vocab 
			- a list of values, separated by commas, used to initialize an array
		- values stored in order
	- *Partial Array initialization*
		- When initializing an array, C++ does not require that every element is given a value
		- if an array is *partially initialized*, all uninitialized elements are set to 0
			- for strings they will be empty strings
		- C++ does not let you 'skip' elements
		- *Implicit Array sizing*
			- it is possible to define an array *without* a size, as long as an *initialization list* is provided
			- C++ will automatically make the array large enough to store the elements in the initialization list
	- *Working with Arrays and Files*
		- Reading contents of a file into an array is straight forward
		- Open file and use a loop to read each item from the file, storing each item into an array element
		- The loop should iterate until the array is filled, or the end of the file is reached
		- [[#7.2.5]]
	- *Writing the Contents of an Array to a File*
		- Also straightforward
		- Loop through the elements, writing contents to a file
		- [[#7.2.6]]
- *7.3 No Bounds Checking in C++*
	- *Concept*: C++ does not prevent you from overwriting an array's bounds.
	- To increase runtime, C++ does not provide many of the common safeguards found in other languages
	- C++ *does not perform bounds checking*
	- This means you can write programs with subscripts that go *beyond* the boundaries of an array
	- This will most likely cause a crash
	- *off-by-one error*: #vocab 
		- An error that occurs when a loop iterates one time too many, or one time too few while stepping through an array
- *7.4 The Range-Based for Loop*
	- *Concept*: The range-base **for** loop is a loop that iterates once for each element in an array. Each time the for loop iterates, it copies an element from the array to a variable. The range-base **for** loop was introduced in *C++ 11*
	- *range-based for loop*: #vocab 
		- A special type of loop that iterates one time per element of an array
	- You *DO NOT* need to use a counter variable to control its iterations
	- No worries about *stepping outside* of the variable's bounds
	- each loop copies an array element to the range variable 
	- it looks like:
		- for ( dataType rangeVariable : array)
			- statement or block
	- the *auto* keyword can be used in place of the data type
		- *auto* will automatically determine the data type based on the array's  data type
	- *Modifying an Array with Range-Based for loops*
		- A the rang-based for loop executes, its range variable contains a *copy* of the array element
		- As a consequence, the range-based for loop cannot modify the array contents
		- *UNLESS* you declare the range variable as a *reference*
- *7.5 Processing Array Contents*
- *7.6 Focus on Software Engineering: Using Parallel Arrays*
- *7.7 Arrays as Function Arguments*
- *7.8 Two-Dimensional Arrays*
- *7.9 Arrays with Three or More Dimensions*
- *7.10 Focus on Problem Solving and Program Design: A Case Study*
- *7.11 Introduction to the STL **vector**

# Code Examples

```

```C++
short hours[6]; // has subscripts 0-5
hours[0] = 20; // accesses the first element and assigns it to 20
// pronounced 'hours sub zero is assigned 20'
```

### 7.2.2
```C++
const int ARRAY_SIZE = 5;
int numbers[ARRAY_SIZE];

{
	// access each element at i, assign it to 99
	numbers[i] = 99;
}
```

const int NUM_EMPLOYEES = 6;
int hours[NUM_EMPLOYEES];
int count;

// Input the hours worked
for (count = 0; count < NUM_EMPLOYEES; count++)
{
	cout << "Enter the hours worked by Employee "
		<< (cout + 1) << ": "; // prints 1 for element 0 for example
	cin >> hours[count];
}

// Display the array contents
cout << "The hours you entered are: "
for (count = 0; count < NUM_EMPLOYEES; count++)
{
	cout << " " << hours[count];
}
cout << endl;

}

inputFile.close();
