## Chapter 3:
- **3.1: The cin Object
	- The **cin** object can be used to read data from the keyboard
	- most programs will ask the user for data
	- variables are assigned said user data
	- **cout** and cin **are** both from **C++'s standard library**
	- **cout** object is used to ask the question
	- The question is known as a *prompt*: #vocab 
		- A question that is displayed, telling the user what data to enter
	- programs should always display a prompt before using cin
	- **>>** is the *stream extraction operator*:
		- An operator that gets data from the stream object and stores the data into a variable
		- object >> variable
	- gathering input is a 2 step process
		- use **cout** to display the prompt
		- use **cin** to read a value from the keyboard
	- the **<<** and **>>** operators **point** in the direction that the data is flowing
		- cout **<<**: data is flowing into the cout object
		- cin **>>**: data is flowing out of the cin object
	- the **cin** object causes program to *wait* until data is entered AND enter key is pressed
	- no other lines in the program are executed until cin is finished
	- cin converts the data read from the keyboard to the data type of the variable used to store it
		- if the user types "10" it is read as the characters '1' and '0'
		- cin is smart enough to know this will be converted to an int value before it is stored into length
		- cin also knows that 10.7 is not a valid integer value
		- cin will drop the value after the decimal point
	- *Entering multiple values*
		- cin can be used to gather multiple values at once
		- cin >> length >> width
		- cin reads each value separated by space
		- can do this for different types as well
	- when the user types values into the keyboard, they are stored in memory in a location known as the *keyboard buffer*: #vocab 
		- an area in memory that temporarily stores characters typed on the keyboard
- **3.2: Mathematical Expressions
	- C++ lets us construct complex mathematical expressions using multiple operators and grouping symbols
	- *expression*: #vocab 
		- a programming statement that has a value
	- usually an expression consists of an operator and its operands
	- variables can be assigned the value of an expression
	- *Associativity*: #vocab 
		- the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated within an expression 
		- basically PEMDAS
- **3.3 When You Mix Apples and Oranges: Type Conversion
	- When an operator's operands are of different data types, C++ will automatically convert them to the same data type. This can affect the math results
	- C++ follows rules to determine what happens to each type
	- data types are ranked by which can hold the largest number
		- long double
		- double
		- float
		- unsigned long long int
		- long long int
		- unsigned long int
		- long int
		- unsigned int
		- int
	- *type coercion*: #vocab 
		- the automatic conversion of operands to the same data type
	- *promoted*: #vocab
		- in this context it means that a value is converted to a higher data type
	- *demoted*: #vocab
		- in this context it means that a value is converted to a lower data type
	- *Rules*:
		- Rule 1: chars, shorts, unsigned shorts are all *promoted* to int
		- Rule 2: when an operator works with two values of different data types, the lower ranking value is *promoted* to the type of the higher ranking value
		- Rule 3: when the final value of an expression is assigned to a variable, it will be converted to the data type of that variable
	- *Integer division*
		- when you divide an integer by another integer, the result is always an integer. remainders are discarded
		- remains true even when the expression is assigned to a float or something else
		- this is not true if one of the operands is another type
- **3.4: Overflow and Underflow
	- When a variable is **assigned** a value that is **too large** or **too small** in range for the data type, the variable *overflows* or *underflows*
	- *overflow*: #vocab
		- The result of assigning a variable a value that is too large for its data type
	- *underflow*: #vocab
		- The result of assigning a variable a value that is too small for its data type
	- when a value overflows, it wraps to the lowest possible value
	- when a value underflows it wraps to the highest possible value
- **3.5: Type Casting
	- **Type Casting** allows you to perform manual data type conversion
	- *type cast expression*: #vocab 
		- an expression that manually *promotes* or *demotes* a value to a specific data type
	- generally look like this: static_cast< DataType >(value)
	- useful for when C++ does not perform the correct conversion automatically
	- can be used to prevent integer division
- **3.6: Multiple Assignment and Combined Assignment
	- Multiple assignment means to assign the *same* value to *several* variables with *one* statement
	- a = b = c = d = 12;
		- results in a thru d all being equal to 12
	- **Combined Assignment Operators**
		- number = number + 1; //adds 1 to the number variable
	- C++ adds special operators for this
	- *combined assignment operators / compound operators / arithmetic assignment operators*: #vocab 
		- +=, -=, etc
		- assigns a variable to itself plus / minus / times another value
- **3.7: Formatting Output
	- The **cout** object provides ways to format data as it is being displayed. This affects the way data appears on the screen
	- cout will default to the standard format for displaying variables
	- stream manipulators let us change this
	- *setw*: #vocab
		- a stream manipulator used to establish print fields of a specified width
		- set width
	- *field width*: #vocab 
		- the minimum number of character positions, or spaces, on the screen to print the value in
		- prints the difference as spaces
			- ex: stew(5) and 23 would print 3 spaces
	- *right-justified*: #vocab 
		- to align a value with the right side of the field, using spaces as padding when needed
	- a new header file, *iomanip* is needed to use *setw*
	- *setw* only establishes a *field width* for the value immediately following it
	- if a value has more digits than setw field, the entire value is printed, cout overrides the setw value
	- *The fixed Manipulator*
		- *setprecision* can sometimes surprise you in an undesirable way
		- when the precision of a number is set to a lower value, numbers tend to be printed in scientific notation
		- *fixed* (stream manipulator) forces cout to print digits in *fixed-point notation*: #vocab
			- notation where a floating point value is displayed with a fixed amount of digits after the decimal point
		- when fixed and setprecision are used, all floats printed afterwards are in fixed point notation
	- *The showpoint Manipulator*
		- By default, floats are not displayed with trailing zeros
		-  *456.0 will display as 456*
		- use showpoint with setprecision to show trailing zeros
	- *The left and right Manipilators*
		- change if text is left or right justified
		- left and right keywords
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-09-09 at 10.31.48 AM.png]]
- **3.8: Working with Characters and String objects
	- Special functions exist for working with characters and string objects
	- cin can cause problems when taking input for strings
	- when cin reads input it ignores any leading *whitespace characters*: #vocab 
		- spaces, tabs or line breaks
	- once it finds the first nonblank character, it starts reading and stops as soon as it hits a whitespace
	- to work around this, use a function called *getline*
	- *getline* reads the entire line, including leading and embedded spaces, and stores it as a string
	- getline(cin, inputline)
		- *cin* is the *input stream*, *inputline* is the *string object* receiving the input
	- *Inputting a character*
		- sometimes you want to only read a single character 
		- using just cin can sometimes do the wrong thing
			- ex: captures a whitespace character that was before the intended character
		- cin object has a built in function called *cin.get()*
			- we call this a member function
		- *member function*: #vocab 
			- aka a method in OOP
			- a function declared and defined within a class. operates on the data members (attributes) of an object belonging to that class and provides the behavior associated with that object
		- can be called in either of the following ways:
			- cin.get(ch)
			- ch = cin.get()
		- can be used to simply pause the screen until enter is pressed
			- cin.get()
	- *Mixing cin >> and cin.get*
		- cin >> and cin.get use slightly different techniques for reading data, leading to problems
		- cin will stop reading at the newline character or null terminator, and cin.get will then read the newline character from the keyboard buffer
		- to solve this, use cin.ignore
		- *cin.ignore(n, c)* ignores n characters or until the character c is encountered, whichever comes first
	- *String Member Functions and Operators*
		- C++ string objects have a number of member functions. For example, if you want to know the length of the string that is stored in a string object, you can call the object's length member function
		- *string.length()* will return the length as an integer
		- you can combine strings by adding them together, + +=
- **3.9: More mathematical Library Functions
	- The C++ runtime library provides several functions for performing complex math ops
	- the < cmath > header file provides the following functions: 
		- ![[Screenshot 2025-09-09 at 11.18.04 AM.png]]
	- pretty easy to use
	- *Random Numbers*
		- < random > provides everything needed to generate random numbers
		- to generate random numbers, you need 2 things
			- a random number engine
			- a distribution object
		- *random number engine*: #vocab 
			- an object used to generate a random sequence of bits
		- *distribution object*: #vocab 
			- an object that reads the random bits provided by the random number engine and produces numbers of a specified data type within a specified range
		- we will primarily use the random_device engine, and uniform_int_distrobution
		- random_device meEngine;
			- creates a new random_device
		- uniform_int_distibution< int > randomInt(0, 100);
			- bracketed int is for int type, can be short, long etc
		- uniform_real_distribution < double > (0.0, 1.0)
			- generates a random floating point
		- *int number = randomInt(myEngine)*
- **3.10: Focus on Debugging: Hand Tracing a Program
	- *Hand tracing*: #vocab 
		- a debugging technique where you pretend you are the computer executing a program, stepping through each statement one by one.
	- helps find math mistakes and logic errors
	- construct a chart with a column for each variable and a row for each line
	- each line, fill out the value of each variable
- **3.11: Focus on Problem Solving: A Case Study
	- General Crates Inc builds wooden crates. With materials and labor it costs $0.23 per cubic food of the crate, and the customer is charged $0.50 per cubic foot. Write a program that calculates the volume in cubic feet, cost, customer price and profit
	- **Variables and Constants**
		- COST_PER_CUBIC_FOOT:
			- named const
			- type double
			- initialized with value 0.23
			- represents the cost to build a crate, per cubic foot
		- CHARGE_PER_CUBIC_FOOT:
			- named const
			- type double
			- initialized with value 0.50
			- represents the customer charge per cubic foot of crate
		- length:
			- type double
			- user input
			- represents the length of the crate
		- width
			- type double
			- user input
			- represents the width of the crate
		- height
			- type double

			- represents the charge of building the crate
		- profit
			- type double
			- calculated
			- represents the profit GCI makes from the crate
	- **Program Design**
		- The program must perform the following general steps
			- ask the user for the dimensions of the crate
			- calculate the crates volume, cost of the crate, charge for the crate, and profit

	- **Calculations**
		- The following formulas will be used to calculate the crate's volume, cost, charge and profit
			- volume = length * width * height
			- cost = volume * 0.23
			- charge = volume * 0.5
			- profit = charge - cost

# Code Examples
```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int length, width, area;

    cout << "What is the length of your rectangle? ";
    cin >> length;

    cout << "What is the width of your rectangle? ";
    cin >> width;

    area = width * length;

    cout << "The rectangle's area is: " << area << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

```C++
/*  Purpose: To demonstrate how to use cout formatting
 *  Input  : None
 *  Output : formatted strings
 */

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num1 = 1, num2 = 245, num3 = 1765, num4 = 837, num5 = 34, num6 = 12;

    // display numbers unformatted
    cout << num1 << " " << num2 << " " << num3 << endl;
    cout << num4 << " " << num5 << " " << num6 << endl;

    // display numbers correctly formatted
    cout << setw(6) << num1 << setw(6) << num2 << setw(6) << num3 << endl;
    cout << setw(6) << num4 << setw(6) << num5 << setw(6) << num6 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
