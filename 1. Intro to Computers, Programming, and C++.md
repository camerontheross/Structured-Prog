## Chapter 1:
- **1.1 Why Program**?
	- Computers can do many different Jobs because they are programmable
	- Computers are designed to do any job you tell them
	- **Program**:
		- A set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task
	- Programs are commonlu referred to as software
	- **Programmer / Software Developer**
		- Someone who is trained to design, create and test computer programs
	- Programming is both an art and a science
	- A few of the things that must be **designed** for any real world program:
		- The logical flow of instructions
		- The mathematical procedures
		- The appearance of the screens
		- The way info is presented to the user
		- the program's "user friendliness"
		- Documentation, help, tutorials, etc.
	- **Scientific / Engineering** side of programming
		- testing
		- correction
		- redesign
		- demands patience, persistence and discipline
		- Programmers must learn [[Languages]] to tell instructions to computers
	- Programming is like designing a car, Both cars and programs should be *functional*, *efficient*, *powerful*,*easy to use*, and *nice to look at*
- **1.2 Computer Systems: Hardware and Software
	- **Hardware** refers to the physical components of a computer.
		- A computer is a **system** of devices rather than one individual device
			- CPU (central processing unit)
			- Main memory
			- secondary storage devices
			- Input devices
			- Output devices
			- ![A flow diagram showing typical components of a computer system.](https://cite-media.pearson.com/legacy_paths/75d70457-a7e0-44fd-9028-ab00cf84ea0a/FG_01_002.png "Figure 1-2 click to zoom")
		- **The CPU**
			- when a computer is performing a task, we say it is **running or executing** the task
			- The CPU is the part that actually runs the program
			- CPU = Brain of computer
			- ENIAC was the worlds first programmable electric computer
				- 8ft tall, 100ft long, 30 tons!
			- CPUs today are small and known as microprocessors
				- smaller and more powerful
			- The JOB of the CPU is to:
				- fetch instructions
				- follow instructions
				- produce some result
			- CPU consists of **TWO PARTS**
				- **CONTROL UNIT**: coordinates all of the CPU's operations. Responsible for for determining where to get the next instruction and regulating the other major components of the computer with control signals
				- **ARITHMETIC and LOGIC UNIT**: Performs math operations
			- When running a program the CPU performs the *fetch / decode / execute* cycle
				- *fetch* : Control unit fetches next instruction, from the sequence of instructions, in main memory
				- *decode*:
					- The instruction is encoded in the form of a number. The control unit decodes the instruction and generates an electronic signal
				- *Execute*:
					- The signal is routed to the appropriate component of the computer. The signal causes the component to do an operation
		- **Main Memory**
			- Main Memory is the compute's work area
			- Programs are stored here while the program runs
			- Main memory is commonly known as RAM
				- CPU is able to quickly access data stored at any random location
			- RAM is volatile, only holds temporary information
			- **byte** is 8 **bits** (usually)
				- **bits** are binary, zeros and ones
			- Each byte is assigned a memory address.
		- **Secondary Storage**
			- holds data for long periods of time
			- Programs are **stored** in secondary memory, and loaded into main memory
			- disk drives:
				- magnetically encodes data onto a disk
			- solid state drives:
				- stores data in solid state memory
				- no moving parts
				- operates faster than disk drive
		- **Input and Output devices**
			- Input is the data the computer collects from the outside world
			- Output is information the computer sends to the outside world
	- **Software** refers to the programs on a computer
		- **System Software**
			- the programs that control and manage the basic operations
				- **Operating Systems**
					- most fundamental set of instructions
					- controls the internal operations of computers hardware,
					- manages the devices connected to the computer
					- allows data to be saved and retrieved from storage devices
					- allows programs to run
				- **Utility Programs**
					- performs a specialized task that enhances computers operation or safeguards data
					- Virus scanners, File compression, Data Backup
				- **Software Development Tools
					- software tools that programmers use
					- create, modify, and test programs
					- Compilers and Integrated Development Tools (IDE)
		- **Application Software**
			- Programs that make a computer useful for everyday tasks
			- usually what people spend the most time using / running
			- spreadsheet programs, word processing, web browsers, games, etc
- **1.3 Programs and Programming Languages**
	- **What is a Program?**
		- Set of instructions that tells Computer how to solve a problem
		- Collectively, a set of instructions is called an *algorithm*
		- Programming languages:
			- instructions that a human can write
			- easier to understand than machine code
			- converted into machine code
		- The code that a programmer writes is **source** code
		- The compiler translates instructions to **object** code
- **1.4 What is a Program Made of?**
	- All programming languages have a few things in common (Language Elements)
		- Key Words / Reserved Words #vocab
			- Words with special meaning
		- Programmer-defined Identifiers #vocab
			- Words or names defined by the dev
			- Symbolic names, refer to variables or routines
		- Operators #vocab
			- perform one or more operands
			- operand: A piece of data, like a number
		- Punctuation #vocab
			- Punctuation characters
			- mark the beginning or end of a statement
			- separate items in a list
		- Syntax #vocab
			- Rules that must be followed while writing code
			- dictates how key words and operators may be used and where punctuation must appear
	- *Sample Code:*
		- ```C++
		//calculate user's pay
		#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;
		int main()
		{
		double hours, rate, pay
			
		 //Get hours worked		
		cout << "How many hours did you work?" ;
		cin >> hours;
			
		 //Get hourly rate
		cout >> "How much are you paid per hour?";
		cin >> rate;
			
		 // Calculate pay
		pay = hours * rate;
			
		 //Display the pay
		cout << "You have earned $" << pay << endl;
		return 0;
		}
		```
	- **Key Words
		- *using, namespace, int, and double*
		- always lowercase
		- only used for intended purpose
	- **Programer-defined identifiers
		- *hours, rate, and pay*
		- names made up by the programmer
		- all variable names in this case 
		- *variables*: The names of memory locations that may hold data
	- **Operators**
		- *=, *
		- * is the multiplication operator
		- =, or *assignment operator*, is used to take the value of an expression and store it in the variable name provided
	- **Punctuation**
		- the semicolon is used to end each line
	- **Lines and Statements**
		- *Statement*: Complete instruction that causes a computer to perform some action
		-  > `` cout << "How many hours did you work?" ; ``
		- semicolon ends the statement
		- C++ statements can be multiple lines
	- **Variables**
		- *Variable*: named storage location in memory for holding a piece of info
		- information *can* change (hence the name variable) while program is running
		- Variables are stored in *RAM* 
	- **Variable Definitions**
		- generally *two* types of variables
			- Numbers
			- Characters
		- Numbers are used to perform math operations
		- Characters are used to print data
		- Numeric data can be further characterized
			- **integers** 5, 7, -100, 78
			- **floating-point numbers** 1.5, 6.782, 0.01
		- `` double hours, rate, pay;``
		- key word *double* means that the variable will be used to hold double precision floating point numbers
		- this is a *variable definition*
			- used to *define* one or more variables
			- *NOT* the same as *variable declaration*
		- variable definition causes the variable to be created in memory
		- all variables must be defined before they can be used
- **1.5 Input, Processing, and Output
	- Programs perform a 3 step process
		- gathering input
		- performing a process on the information gathered
		- producing an output
	- *Input*
		- information a program gathers from the outside world
		- can be sent to the program by the user through the keyboard and mouse
		- can be read from the disk files or hardware devices
		- *cin >>* is used to perform input operations in C++
	- *Output*
		- information that the program sends to outside world
		- can be displayed on a screen
		- sent to a printer
		- stored in a file
		- sent to any connected device
		- *cout <<* is used to perform output in C++
- **1.6 The Programming Process
	- Designing and creating a program
		- __1. Clearly define what the program is to do__
			- Requires you to identify the: *Purpose*, *Input*, *Process*, and *Output*
			- Ex:
				- *Purpose*: To calculate the user's gross pay
				- *Input*: Number of hours worked, hourly pay rate.
				- *Process*: Multiply number of hours worked by hourly pay rate. The result is the user's gross pay
				- *Output*: Display a message indicating the user's gross pay
		- __2. Visualize the program running on the computer__
			- create the program in your mind
			- imagine what the computer screen looks like
			- draw pictures if it helps
			- put yourself in the shoes of the user
				- what messages should the program display?
				- What questions does it ask?
			- Addressing these concerns lets us determine the program's output
		- **3. Use design tools (hierarchy chart, flow chart, pseudocode) to create a model of the program**
			- *hierarchy Chart*
				- diagram that depicts the structure of a program
				- boxes represent each *step* in the program
				- boxes are connected in a way that depicts the relationship to one another
				- ![A hierarchy chart shows the pay-calculating program.](https://cite-media.pearson.com/legacy_paths/cdf4176a-f7ed-4a34-8084-a343a8d2cfe8/FG_01_012.png "Figure 1-12 click to zoom")
			- *Flowchart*
				- diagram that shows the logical flow of a program
				- useful for planning each operation a program preforms
				- the order in which the operations are to be preformed
				- ![[Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 1.50.03 PM.png]]
			- *Pseudocode*
				- cross between human language and programming language
				- *almost* a programming language
		- **4. Check the model for logical errors**
			- *Logical errors*: mistakes that cause the program to produce erroneous results
			- trace through the design and check the logic of each stem
			- if an error is found the model can be corrected
		- **5. Type the code, save, and compile**
			- write the source code!
			- save and compile
			- compiler will find any syntax errors 
		- **6. Correct any errors found during compilation, repeat 5-6**
			- fix the syntax errors
		- **7. Run the program with test data for input**
			- test for *runtime errors*
			- *runtime error*: occurs when a program is running. Usually logical errors like mathematical mistakes
			- sample data is required
			- sample data should be predictable
		- **8. Correct errors found while running the program repeat 5-8**
			- identify the step where error occurs
			- determine the cause
			- *Desk-checking*: programmer ready the program, steps through each statement on paper. Note down variable changes and when information is displayed. 
		- **9. Validate the results of the program**
			- when all errors are fixed, enter test data and determine whether the program solves the original problem
	- A good program *always* begins with planning
- **1.7 Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming
	- two ways of thinking about software development and program design
	- C++ can be used for both methods
	- *Procedural Programing*
		- Programmer constructs procedures (functions)
		- Procedures are a collection of programming statements that perform a specific task
		- Procedures each contain their own variables and commonly share variables with other procedures
		- *centered on the procedure (function)*
	- *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*
		- *Object*: programming element that contains data and the procedures that operate on the data
		- self contained unit
		- objects contain both information and the ability to manipulate that information
		- when an object receives a message instructing it to perform some operation, it carries out the instruction
		- *centered on the object*
