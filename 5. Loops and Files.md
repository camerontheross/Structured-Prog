- *5.1 The **Increment** and **Decrement** Operators*
	- *Concept*: ++ and -- are operators that add and subtract 1 from their operands
	- to increment a value means to increase it by one
	- to decrement a value means to decrease it by one
	- num = num + 1, num += 1, num++
	- num = num - 1, num -= 1, num--
	- *postfix mode*: #vocab 
		- operator is placed _after_ the variable
	- *prefix mode*: #vocab 
		- operator is placed *before* the variable
	- increments and decrements work in both postfix and prefix modes
	- *The difference between Postfix and Prefix modes*
		- *simple* statement is that it doesn't matter
		- the difference **IS** important
		- cout << num++;
			- num is *outputted* and then *incremented*
		- cout << ++num; 
			- num ins *incremented* then *outputted*
	- *Using ++ and -- in mathematical expressions*
		- c = a * b++
			- c is equal to a times b, then b is incremented
		- c = a * ++b
			- c is equal to a times (b+1)
		- c = ++(a * b) // does not work!
		- operators only work on *Ivalues*
	- *Using ++ and -- in Relational Expressions*
		- x = 10; if (x++ > 10)
			- false
		- if (++x > 10)
			- true!

- *5.2 Introduction to Loops: The while Loop*
	- *Concept*: A loop is a part of a program that repeats
	- *Loop*: #vocab 
		- a *control* *structure* that causes a *statement* or *block* to repeat
	- C++ has *three* looping control structures
		- while loop
		- do-while
		- for loop
	- The difference lies in how they control repetition
	- *The while loop*:
	- the while loop has two important parts
		- an expression that is tested for a true or false value
		- a statement or block that is repeated as long as the expression is true
	- while (expression)
		- statement;
	- *loop header*: #vocab 
		- the first line in a while loop
	- *loop body*: #vocab 
		- the body of the loop that is executed while the expression is true
	- no semicolon after the expression's parenthesis
	- { } required for using blocks
	- works like an if statement that repeats itself over and over
	- *The while loop is a **Pretest** Loop*
		- the while loop is a *pretest loop*: #vocab 
			- the loop tests the expression *before* each iteration
		- [[#5.1.1]] will run 5 times but [[#5.1.2]] will never run since number is greater than 5
		- the loop *never* iterates if the test expression is false before it
	- *Infinite Loops*
		- in all but rare cases, loops *must* contain within themselves a way to terminate
		- something within the loop has to at some point make it false
		- if a loop doesn't have any way of stopping, it is called an *infinite loop*
		- infinite loops continue to repeat until the program is interrupted
		- it is possible to create an infinite loop by placing a semicolon after the expression
			- while (num < 5);
			- disconnects the block of code after it
			- this makes the while loop infinitely execute the null statement
			- does nothing infinitely 
	- *Programming Style and the while loop*
		- while (expression) {statements}
			- avoid this
		- visually set the block apart from the expression
- *5.3 Using the while Loop for input Validation*
	- *Concept*: The while loop can be used to create input routines that repeat until acceptable data is entered
	- garbage in, garbage out
	- *Input validation*: #vocab 
		- the process of inspecting data given clear instructions about the kind of input that is acceptable
		- does not assume the user has followed these instructions
	- the while loop is really good for this
	- if an invalid value is entered the while loop can run as many times as it takes to get a good value
	- [[#5.3.1]]
- *5.4 Counters*
	- *Concept*: A counter is a variable that is regularly incremented or decremented each time a loop iterates
	- Sometimes a program needs to keep track of the number of times a loop iterates
	- in [[#5.4.1]] the variable **num**, which starts at 1, is incremented each time thru the loop
	- *counter variable*: #vocab 
		- variable that is regularly incremented or decremented each time a loop iterates
- *5.5 The do-while Loop*
	- *Concept*: The *do-while* loop is a *posttest* loop, meaning the expression is tested after each iteration
	- the *do-while* loop looks like an inverted *while*
		- do
			- statement;
		- while (expression);
	- *posttest loop*: #vocab 
		- it tests the expression *after* each iteration
	- the do-while loop always executes *at least once*
	- [[#5.5.1]]
	- *user-controlled loop*: #vocab 
		- A loop that allows the user to control the amount of times a loop is iterated
	- *Using do-while with Menus*:
		- the do-while loop is a good choice for repeating a menu 
- *5.6 The for Loop*
	- *Concept*: The **for** loop is ideal for performing a known number of iterations
	- in general there are *two* categories of loops
		- conditional loops
		- count-controlled loops
	- *conditional loop*: #vocab 
		- executes as long as a particular condition exists
	- *count-controlled loop* #vocab
		- repeats a specific number of times
	- loop that prints the sales report for each month will run 12 times
	- *count-controlled loop* must contain 3 things:
		- It must initialize a counter variable to a starting value
		- it must test the counter variable by comparing it to a max value. When the value is reached, the loop terminates
		- It must update the counter during each iteration
	- for (initialization; test; update)
		- statement;
	- [[#5.6.1]]
	- sequence of events in a for loop:
		- 1. perform initialization
		- 2. evaluate test expression. If true, continue
		- 3. execute body
		- 4. update, repeat from step 2
	- counter variable defined inside of the loop can be used in the body
	- [[#5.6.2]] refactor program [[#5.4.1]] with for loop
	- *Using for loop instead of while or do-while*
		- Always use *for* loop when you  
			- clearly need to initialize
			- use a false statement to stop the loop
			- require an update at the end of every iteration
	- For loops are *pretest* loops even tho they test after an iteration
	- *avoid* modifying the *counter* variable in the body of a for loop
	- variables can be *defined* in the initialization expression
	- for loops can be created where a user determines the max value
	- multiple statements can be executed in the initialization expression
	- *initialization* can be *omitted* from the parenthesis: ( ; x < y; x++)
- *5.7 Keeping a running total*
	- *Concept*: A running total is a *sum* of numbers that *accumulates* with each *iteration* of a loop. The variable used to keep the running total is called an *accumulator*
	- Many programming tasks require you to calculate the total of a series of numbers
	- These require *two* elements:
		- A loop that reads each number in the series
		- A variable that accumulates the total of the numbers as they are read
	- *Accumulator*: #vocab 
		- The variable used to accumulate the total of the variables
	- [[#5.7.1]]
- *5.8 Sentinels*
	- *Concept*: A sentinel is a special value that marks the end of a list of values
	- Sometimes a user doesn't know how many items they have to enter in
	- maybe there are several lists
	- it is impractical to require that every item is counted
	- *Sentinel*: #vocab
		- A special value that cannot be mistaken as a member of the list
		- signals that there are no more values, terminates loop
	- values like -1 or 0 are good since things often can't be negative, or zero
- *5.9 Focus on Software engineering: Deciding which Loop to Use*
	- *Concept*: Although most repetitive algorithms can be written with any one of these loops, each has its best use case(s)
	- *While*
		- pretest loop
		- repeats as long as a condition exists
		- you don't want iteration if condition is false from the beginning
		- validating input
		- sentinel termination
	- *Do-while*
		- Posttest loop
		- always want at least one iteration
		- menu repeating
	- *For*
		- pretest loop
		- built in expressions for initializing, testing and updating
		- good to use counter controlled iterations
		- can init counter to starting value
		- test the counter value
		- update counter
		- number of iterations is known
- *5.10 Nested Loops*
	- *Concept*: A loop inside a loop is called a nested loop
	- an inner loop goes thru all of its iterations for each iteration of an outer loop
	- inner loops complete their iterations faster than outer loops
	- to get total number of iterations, multiply number of iterations of all the loops
- *5.11 Using Files for Data Storage*
	- *Concept*: When a program needs to save data for later use, it writes the data in a file. The data can then be read from the file later
	- Programs used daily usually rely on files
	- *writing data:* #vocab 
		- what programmers call saving data
	- when data is written to a file, it is copied from a variable RAM to the file
	- *output file*: #vocab 
		- a file which data is written to
	- *reading data:* #vocab 
		- retrieving data from a file
	- *input file:* #vocab 
		- a file from which data is read
	- When a file is used by a program, three steps must occur
		- Open the file
		- Process the file
		- Close the file
	- *Types of files*
		- two types
			- Text
			- Binary
		- *Text file*: #vocab 
			- a file that contains data that has been encoded as text, using a scheme like ASCII or Unicode
		- *Binary file*: #vocab 
			- a file containing data that has not been converted to text
	- *File access methods*
		- two ways to access data from a file
			- sequential access
			- direct / random access 
		- *Sequential-access file*: #vocab 
			- a file where the data is accessed in sequential order
		- *random-access file*: #vocab 
			- a file where you jump around to access data 
		- CDs and MP3 players use random access
		- sequential access is easy to work with
	- *Filenames and File Stream Objects*
		- Files on a disk are identified by a *filename*
		- each OS has filename rules
		- *filename extensions*: #vocab
			- a sequence of characters that follow a file name to indicate what type of file it is
		- in order to work with files on the computer's disk, you need a *file stream object*
		- *file stream object*: #vocab 
			- an object that is associated with a specific file and provides a way for the program to work with that object
		- file stream objects work similarly to cin and cout
	- *Setting Up a Program for File Input / Output*
		- include < fstream >
		- fstream defines data types:
			- *ofstream*
				- Output file stream
				- used to create a file and write to it
			- *ifstream*
				- input file stream
				- open an existing file and read data from it
			- *fstream*
				- file stream
				- both
	- *Creating a File Object and Opening a File*
		- a file stream object must be created
		- the file must be opened and linked to the file stream object
		- open a file to read: [[#5.11.1]]
		- open a file to write: [[#5.11.2]]
		- when opening a file you may need to give the file's path
		- it is possible to define a file stream object and open the file at the same time
			- ifstream inputFile("customers.txt")
	- *Closing a File*
		- files are closed when a program shuts down
		- it is good practice to close a file when done with them
		- why?
			- Most OSs temporarily store data in a file buffer before it is written to a file
			- A file buffer is a small holding section of memory where file-bound data is first written
			- This improves performance
			- closing a file causes unsaved data to be saved to a file
			- Some OS limit how many files can be open at one time
		- to close a file, use file.close()
	- *Writing data to a file*
		- similar to cin 
		- <<
	- *Reading data from a file*
		- similar to cout
		- >>
	- *The read position*
		- when a file has been opened for input, the file stream object internally maintains a special value known as a *read position*
		- A file's read position marks the location of the next byte that will be read from the file
		- initially set to the first byte
		- goes to next byte as a file is read
		- when reaching things like "\n" the read position knows that the value is terminated
	- *numeric* data is *automatically* converted to a numeric value
	- loops are used to process *large* amounts of data into or out of a file
	- *Detecting the end of a file*
		- we have to read the file not knowing how many items are in the file
		- error if program tries to read beyond the contents of a file
		- >> reads a true or false value indicating if the data was successfully extracted
		- while (inputFile >> number)
	- *Testing for file open errors*
		- The open member doesn't work under certain conditions
			- what happens if the provided file does not exist
		- after calling the *open* function, test the file stream object as if it was a boolean
		- you can also use the *fail()* method to test this
	- The user can specify a filename
	- prior to *C++ 11*, a files stream object's open member function will not take a string as an argument
	- The file *MUST* be passed as a *null terminated* string (C string)
	- string objects have a member function named "c_str" that returns the string contents formatted as a C-string
- *5.12 Optional Topics: Breaking and Continuing a Loop*
	- *Concept*: The *break* statement causes a loop to *terminate* *early*. The *continue* statement causes a loop to *stop* its *current* *iteration* and *begin* the *next* one
	- *Break* can be placed inside of a loop
	- *Using break in a Nested Loop*
		- *break* only interrupts the loop in which it is placed
		- if placed in the inner loop, it only stops the inner loop 
	- *The continue Statement*
		- the *continue* statement causes the *current* iteration of a loop to *end* __immediately__
		- when continue is encountered the statements below it are ignored
		- in a *while* loop the *program* jumps to the *test* expression
		- if the test expression is still *true* then the program continues
